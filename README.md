# BatchRip
Shell Scripts from Yamada's auto-ripping/tagging software build

Hey folks, 
In November of 2019, the TVdb changed their API system and doing so broke a lot of software/programming that relied on the previous API. Robert Yamada's BatchRip actions was one of the programs that lost functionality. As a long time fan of open-source and of Yamada's efforts, I wanted to step up to help. I'm not a GitHub expert but I figured I'd get things started for the community. 

We've issued corrections to three of Yamada's shell scripts. This document will explain what each script does and WHERE it's located.

Script #1: the MASTER BatchRip script - called "main.command" - which is located at:
/Applications/Batch\ Rip\ Actions\ for\ Automator.app/Contents/Library/Automator/Batch\ Rip.action/Contents/Resources/

You can find the updated version of script #1 on our GitHub build here: https://github.com/tallfunnyjew/BatchRip/blob/master/Library/Automator/Batch%20Rip.action/Contents/Resources/main.command

Script #2: the Rename TV Items master script - also called "main.command" - which is located at:
/Applications/Batch\ Rip\ Actions\ for\ Automator.app/Contents/Library/Automator/Rename\ TV\ Items.action/Contents/Resources/main.command

You can find the updated version of script #2 on our GitHub build here: 
https://github.com/tallfunnyjew/BatchRip/blob/master/Library/Automator/Rename%20TV%20Items.action/Contents/Resources/main.command

Script #3: the Tag TV Items script - also called "main.command" - which is located at:
/Applications/Batch\ Rip\ Actions\ for\ Automator.app/Contents/Library/Automator/Add\ TV\ Tags.action/Contents/Resources/main.command

You can find the updated version of script #3 on our GitHub build here: 
https://github.com/tallfunnyjew/BatchRip/blob/master/Library/Automator/Add%20TV%20Tags.action/Contents/Resources/main.command
